# AI4H project 
This is a university student project for the class "AI in Healthcare" at the University of Leipzig.
In this project, various algorithms are trained and tested to predict a healthy or unhealthy patient with the PERG-IOBA dataset (https://physionet.org/content/perg-ioba-dataset/1.0.0/) of 
Pattern Electroretinograms for Ocular Electrophysiology Research.
The code and annotations can be found in the jupyter notebook ai4h.ipynb. The requirements to run the code are documented in the requirements.txt. 
For the code to run, the data needs to be downloaded and stored in ./a-comprehensive-dataset-of-pattern-electroretinograms-for-ocular-electrophysiology-research-the-perg-ioba-dataset-1.0.0/csv/...
